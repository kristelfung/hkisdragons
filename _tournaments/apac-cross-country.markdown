welcome: "Greetings Running Enthusiasts,\nAs I write this, we are reeling from the
  effects of Typhoon Manghkut and after seeing the devastation to the trees in our
  neighborhood, I can only hope that we will be able to run the course we have planned
  for October.  Hong Kong is a resilient city and I am confident that which ever course
  is best suited for our run, each and every one of you will be surprised to find
  how green our city is.  \n\nAPAC has a long history of bringing international students
  together to compete.  It is a time to reconnect with old friends you may have raced
  against last year or to make new friendships with new APAC peers.  This is the first
  time we have hosted Cross Country and we hope that you enjoy running in the rolling
  hills around Tai Tam Reservoir which is located, more or less, in HKIS’ back yard.\n\nRun
  fast, run hard and enjoy the natural side of what most of the world thinks is a
  “concrete jungle.”  Best of luck to each of you!\n\nSincerely\nSharon H. Leung"
