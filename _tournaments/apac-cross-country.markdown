welcome: "Greetings Running Enthusiasts,\n\n\nAs I write this, we are reeling from
  the effects of Typhoon Manghkut and after seeing the devastation to the trees in
  our neighborhood, I can only hope that we will be able to run the course we have
  planned for October.  Hong Kong is a resilient city and I am confident that which
  ever course is best suited for our run, each and every one of you will be surprised
  to find how green our city is.  \n\n\nAPAC has a long history of bringing international
  students together to compete.  It is a time to reconnect with old friends you may
  have raced against last year or to make new friendships with new APAC peers.  This
  is the first time we have hosted Cross Country and we hope that you enjoy running
  in the rolling hills around Tai Tam Reservoir which is located, more or less, in
  HKIS’ back yard.\n\n\nRun fast, run hard and enjoy the natural side of what most
  of the world thinks is a “concrete jungle.”  Best of luck to each of you!\n\n\nSincerely\nSharon
  H. Leung"
