welcome: "HKIS is happy to welcome all our guests from overseas and from across the
  border!  We are excited to host teams from Singapore, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand as
  well as our neighbor to the north, new entry on the girl’s side – Shanghai American
  School- Puxi. We wish all teams the best of luck and are excited to welcome back
  our teams that have a long history here at the Holiday Tournament as well as our
  newest competitors.  \n\nWe would like to thank our administration and community
  for their support of this event.  Another huge thank you goes to our homestay families
  who open their homes to visiting players over the holiday weekend.  It is heartwarming
  to hear the excitement of visiting players describing some of the feasts that they
  have been part of year after year.   We truly appreciate our families rolling out
  the red carpet for our overseas players. \n\nPlay hard, play fair continues to be
  our motto for these tournaments.  I am always reminded what good sportsmanship our
  teams possess at these tournaments and look forward to seeing competitive games
  that end with a handshake.  All the best to players and coaches over the next few
  days!!\n\n\n\nSincerely,\nSharon H. Leung\nHKIS Athletic Director                    \n"
