welcome: "Welcome to Hong Kong!  Hong Kong International School is excited to host
  this year’s Asia Pacific Activities Conference– Asia Division Girls Soccer Championships.
  \ This year’s competition will feature fantastic soccer athletes from Canadian Academy
  (Kobe), Seoul Foreign School, Shanghai American School-Pudong, Western Academy of
  Beijing, United Nations International School Hanoi as well as hosts Hong Kong International
  School.  \n\n\nDid you know that France will host the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup
  this summer?  These championships are held every four years with the first championship
  held in 1991.  Since it’s beginning, teams from US (3), Germany(2), Norway and Japan
  have gone onto to be crowned champions.  This year’s competition will be hard fought
  – much like our own APAC championships.  \n\n\nWe hope that you enjoy your time
  here in our beautiful city.  HKIS is lucky to be set against the backdrop of sea
  and mountain in the Tai Tam area of the southern district of Hong Kong Island.  Many
  thanks to our homestay families who opened their homes this weekend and served as
  ambassadors for our community.\n\nBest of luck to all teams – play hard, play fair!!
  \ We hope that you leave Hong Kong having revisited old friendships,  made some
  new ones, and had a blast playing a sport that you are passionate about.  All the
  best - - \n\n\nSharon H. Leung\nAthletics Director\nHKIS\n"
